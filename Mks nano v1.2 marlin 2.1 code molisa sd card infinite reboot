Hello 
I am new to Marlin software this is my first
Custom code I have tried I am using molisa marlin
V2.1.
Everything works perfect the printer boots up 
Perfect and everything else perfect but with 
The sd card inserted the printer keeps rebooting 
I have looked up information for the last 2 weeks 
And tried everything.
Deactivated sd support fail 
Change the pin fail 
Tried different versions of firmware and when 
I do esteps it changes both extruder 1 and 2 
Where on the molisa I can change them individually 
I manufacture parts and need it to be spot on 
Everytime.
Can anyone please assist also this is my first 
Post and GITHUB feels confusing to me.
I can upload the whole code later when I have 
Access to the pc.
I have formatted the sd card fat32 and used 3 
Different ones and still the same problem.
I have no idea how to solve this problem.
Can anyone please assist.
I also found the code on GITHUB.
